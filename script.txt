I believe you guys already know I'm a web developer and I like programming.
So I wanna talk about `Why I like programming?`
##
Then why do you think I do programming?
For the money? for the fame?
Of course not!
##
Because it's very fun and I can make whatever I want.
I can make my own game or I can make my own web site like this.
Yeah it's pretty cool~
##
And now, I wanna give you a quiz.
Do you know what is a common thing among these twitter, SoundCloud, instagram and etc etc.
##
It's a service based on IT.
##
Do you know SoundCloud?
You can upload your own music on it.
And you can listen and find a good music and musicians.
You know or not, most of independent musicians use this site to promote their songs. 

How cool?
If we have a brilliant idea or business item, you just make it and be a trend.
Anyone can be a trendsetter and make new culture like facebook or instagram.
And you also can do this if you want to.

I majored in semi conductor and I wasn't able to feel this feelings when I was in college.

And like I said you can make whatever you want through programming.
You can make your own Kakao talk or Facebook for your friends.
Or you can automatize your simple daily works.
And furthermore you can build your own business like 배달의민족 or 쿠팡

That's why I really like programming.
##
And I prepared some simple web application for fun.

And that's it thank you for listening and I hope you enjoyed it.
Thank you!
